        <p>As an avid boba lover driven by a passion for exceptional taste and service, I am excited to present my definitive guide to the top boba spots on campus.</p>
        <p>I will be ranking the following stores: Koala, MoMo Tea, Gong Cha, and Mogee Tea</p>
        <p>I will be ranking each store by the following criterion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Taste</li>
          <li>Consistency of Quality</li>
          <li>Service</li>
          <li>Ambiance</li>
          <li>Menu Options</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>MoMo Tea</li>
            <p>Walking into MOMO you will be greeted by friendly employees who are happy to give you recommendations on their menu. The boba is always cooked to perfection and the taste is unbeatable. Going to MOMO is an experience with a side of great boba! My absolute favorite order is their boba gaga with lychee jelly instead of pineapple. This place is great for milk tea and fruit tea lovers.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Taste: 10/10</li>
              <li>Consistency of Quality: 8/10</li>
              <li>Service: 10/10</li>
              <li>Ambiance: 9/10</li>
              <li>Menu Options: 8/10</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Koala</li>
            <p>Koala has 2 East Lansing locations on Grand River. The more central location is a takeout style and the other location has sit down options. Out of all of the boba on campus, Koala has the most diverse menu with plenty of food options to keep you satiated during long study sessions. One shortcoming is that they often get orders wrong but they are always happy to fix their mistake.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Taste: 9/10</li>
                <li>Consistency of Quality: 6/10</li>
                <li>Service: 8/10</li>
                <li>Ambiance: 7/10</li>
                <li>Menu Options: 9/10</li>
              </ul>
          <li>Gong Cha</li>
            <p>Gong Cha is a new boba competitor located on the east side of Grand River. They have large tables suitable for big groups as well as small tables for individuals. The interior is appealing however their topping choices fall short.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Taste: 7/10</li>
              <li>Consistency of Quality: 8/10</li>
              <li>Service: 8/10</li>
              <li>Ambiance: 9/10</li>
              <li>Menu Options: 5/10</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Mogee Tea</li>
            <p>Mogee Tea is located in central Grand River and makes for a great study spot with friends. If you are lactose intolerant or hate milk teas, you may be out of luck here because their menu is very milk tea focused. They offer some unique boba options such as their cheese foam that seems to come with every drink. Not a huge fan of this place as an fruit tea lover.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Taste: 4/10</li>
              <li>Consistency of Quality: 6/10</li>
              <li>Service: 7/10</li>
              <li>Ambiance: 6/10</li>
              <li>Menu Options: 3/10</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Eating my way through Japan and Korea</h3>
        <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiana-may/">Kiana May</a></address>
        <time datetime="2023-06-27" title="June 27, 2023">Jun 27, 2023</time>
        <p>This summer I traveled to Japan and Korea with my family. As any normal person would do, I meticulously planned each day to align with my foodie desires. Here are some of my favorite highlights including restaurants, snacks and dishes that I tried this summer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>7 Eleven Dango</li>
            <p>Dango is a sweet and savory Japanese mochi dessert. It consists of 4 mochi balls on a skewer with a sweet soy based sauce. 7-Eleven's take on dango was my personal favorite snack to pick-up after a long day in the heat.</p>
          <li>Bingsu</li>
            <p>Bingsu is a Korean shaved ice dessert perfect as a refreshing treat in the summer. The ice is shaved into fine, snow-like flakes giving it its signature fluffy texture. My favorite Bingsu I tried was from a small street shop in Hongdae. It was made with a yogurt/milk base topped with condensed milk and mandarin oranges.</p>
            <img src="bingsu.jpeg" alt="bingsu dessert with oranges on top">
            <li>Tteokbokki</li>
            <p>Tteokbokki is a popular Korean street food known for its spicy kick. It consists of soft chewy rice cakes cooked in a spicy chili paste-based sauce. While it is a popular street food many restaurants serve the dish family style on hotplates allowing the customers to add as much customization as they want. Trying this family style tteokbokki was one of the highlights of my Korea trip.</p>
          <li>Japanese Curry</li>
            <p>Japanese curry is a super rounded dish that is one of my favorite meals. My favorite variation is my grandpa's recipe using fresh vegetables he picks from the family garden. The curry consists of curry roux, garden potatoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes and thinly sliced pork and is served over a bed of fluffy japanese rice.</p>
